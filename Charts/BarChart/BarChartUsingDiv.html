  <h3>Bar chart with Divs and D3</h3>

  <p>This is a very simple example. In this we don't handle changing the dataset to a particular range, scaling and displaying the axes for the bar chart.</p>

  <script>
  var dataset = [2, 3, 6, 20, 13, 5, 13, 14];

  /*
    the usual pattern, selectAll is used to select all the elements "div" in this case with current selection(body).
    We know currently there aren't any. So basically it is currently holding dummy divs for us once with attach data using data() method
    .enter() is where this is all happening
    .append actually attaches the "div"s equal to the count of datasets and attaches it the DOM and we can now inspect and see it.
    .attr and .style are simply for adding class and styling which is normal CSS
  */
  d3.select("body").selectAll("div")
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append("div")
      .attr("class", "bar")
      .style("height", function(d) {
          var barHeight = d * 10;
          return barHeight + "px";
      });
