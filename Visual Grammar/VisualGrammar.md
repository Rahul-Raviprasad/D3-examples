# Visual Grammar

Basics
* Color, Shape, size and proximity
Few things to keep in mind, like almost similar shades of a color doesn't give off the information out to user properly whereas many distinct colors make can make it look ugly, similarly if some element is disproportionately large, it can come across as the most important piece of information, while that may not be the original intent.
* Economy
Focus on that data which tells your story, no need to show all the information and take up screen/page space. Like you could have fancy visual element that takes the viewer focus away from the important information you want to tell with the other elements.
* Hierarchy
Sometimes helps with order in which things should fall
* Emphasis
* Abstraction
Use to tell a story.
