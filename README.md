# D3-examples
My collection of notes and examples on data visualization

## Data Visualization

It has to communicate to the person viewing it what needs to be conveyed in a easy way.

It is not a tool to
1. manipulate the Data
2. modify the Data
3. fool a user
4. only to make data pretty

Data visualization can be done as simply as with pen and paper.

> The Question that we need to keep asking ourself is
> "what does this data tell us?"


### Data sources

* Data you collected: sometimes this is the toughest data to work with, since you might already be familiar with what is and not looking at it from an outsider eyes.
* Open source data: many data sources are freely available

### What does your data say?
* How much and what percent?
* Trends :  generally you can present an x axis and show how they changed over time.
* Correlations
* geographic

### How to do Data Visualization
* whats your goals
* pinpoint your audience
* align your content to goals and audience
* Structure your story

Doing this is not really easy
finding people with data analysis, visualization, coding and designing skill is very difficult.
